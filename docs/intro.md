# PAI Documentation

Welcome to the **Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)** documentation — version 2.4.

PAI is an open-source framework that transforms Claude Code from a generic AI assistant into a personalized AI system that knows your goals, remembers your context, and improves over time.

## What Makes PAI Different

Most AI tools are stateless. You ask a question, get an answer, and the AI forgets everything. PAI changes that:

| Traditional AI | PAI |
|---------------|-----|
| Starts fresh each session | Remembers past work and decisions |
| Generic responses | Knows your preferences and goals |
| Single capability | Modular skills that route intelligently |
| No learning | Captures signals and improves over time |

## The Mission

**AI should magnify everyone—not just the top 1%.**

PAI exists to solve what we believe is a critical problem: only a tiny fraction of humanity's creative potential is activated. Most people have never articulated who they are or what they're working toward. PAI helps you discover, document, and pursue your goals with AI as your partner.
