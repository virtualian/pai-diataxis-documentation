# How to Use the Algorithm

Execute complex tasks using THE ALGORITHM's structured methodology.

## Prerequisites

- `pai-algorithm-skill` pack installed

## Basic Usage

### Invoke the Algorithm

Simply ask Claude to run the algorithm:

```
Run the algorithm to refactor the authentication system
```

Or use the explicit trigger:

```
Use the algorithm: implement dark mode for the settings page
```

### Override Effort Level

Force a specific effort level:

```
Algorithm effort THOROUGH: design a new API architecture
```

## The 7 Phases

The algorithm executes in phases:

1. **OBSERVE** - Understand the request and context
2. **THINK** - Ensure nothing is missing
3. **PLAN** - Sequence work and assign capabilities
4. **BUILD** - Make requirements testable
5. **EXECUTE** - Do the work
6. **VERIFY** - Test each completion
7. **LEARN** - Output for user feedback

## ISC (Ideal State Criteria)

The algorithm creates an ISC table tracking what "ideal" looks like:

```
| # | What Ideal Looks Like | Source | Status |
|---|----------------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Toggle component works | EXPLICIT | DONE |
| 2 | Theme state persists | EXPLICIT | ACTIVE |
| 3 | Tests pass | IMPLICIT | PENDING |
```

## Effort Levels

Higher effort unlocks more capabilities:

| Level | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| TRIVIAL | Skip algorithm, direct answer |
| QUICK | haiku model, Intern agent |
| STANDARD | sonnet, research agents, Engineer |
| THOROUGH | Council debate, Architect, Pentester |
| DETERMINED | opus, RedTeam (32 agents), unlimited iteration |

## Tips

- Let the algorithm classify effort automatically for most tasks
- Use DETERMINED for mission-critical work
- The ISC grows as research discovers more requirements
- Each phase gates the next - no skipping
