# The Algorithm Philosophy

THE ALGORITHM is PAI's universal execution engine, applying scientific method to achieve ideal outcomes.

## Core Purpose

> Produce euphoric, highly surprising, exceptional results that solve the problem better than expected.

The algorithm exists to bridge the gap between "good enough" and "exceptional."

## Scientific Method for AI

Traditional AI assistance is reactive: you ask, it answers. The algorithm is proactive:

1. **Observe** - Understand fully before acting
2. **Hypothesize** - Define what "ideal" looks like
3. **Experiment** - Execute with appropriate resources
4. **Verify** - Test against ideal criteria
5. **Learn** - Capture insights for future work

## The ISC (Ideal State Criteria)

Every non-trivial task gets an ISC - a living document of what "ideal" looks like:

```
| # | What Ideal Looks Like | Source | Status |
|---|----------------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Toggle component works | EXPLICIT | DONE |
| 2 | Theme persists on refresh | INFERRED | ACTIVE |
| 3 | No accessibility regressions | IMPLICIT | PENDING |
```

### Sources

- **EXPLICIT** - User literally said this
- **INFERRED** - Derived from context (tech stack, past work)
- **IMPLICIT** - Universal standards (security, quality, tests)

The ISC grows as research discovers more requirements. A DETERMINED effort task might have hundreds of ISC rows.

## Effort Classification

Not every task needs the same resources. Effort classification gates capabilities:

| Effort | When | Capabilities |
|--------|------|-------------|
| TRIVIAL | Simple questions | Direct answer, skip algorithm |
| QUICK | Single-step tasks | Basic agent, one iteration |
| STANDARD | Multi-step work | Research, Engineer, QA |
| THOROUGH | Complex features | Council debate, Architect |
| DETERMINED | Mission-critical | Everything, unlimited iteration |

## Why Gating Matters

Giving every task maximum resources wastes time and money. But under-resourcing important work produces mediocre results.

The algorithm's effort classification ensures:
- Simple tasks stay simple
- Complex tasks get proper attention
- Resources match stakes

## Iteration

When verification fails, the algorithm loops back:
- Unclear ideal? → Back to THINK
- Wrong approach? → Back to PLAN
- Execution error? → Back to EXECUTE

Iteration count is bounded by effort level, preventing infinite loops while allowing persistence for important work.
