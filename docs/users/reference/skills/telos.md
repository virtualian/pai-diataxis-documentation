# Telos Skill

Life OS and deep goal capture framework. Telos helps you identify, articulate, and pursue your purpose through structured self-documentation.

## Triggers

The Telos skill activates when you say:
- "Telos", "my telos"
- "life goals", "what are my goals"
- "goals", "update goals"
- "challenges", "my challenges"
- "mission", "my mission"

## The Telos Framework

Telos consists of 10 interconnected capture files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **MISSION.md** | Your core purpose and reason for being |
| **GOALS.md** | Concrete objectives you're working toward |
| **PROJECTS.md** | Active initiatives that advance your goals |
| **BELIEFS.md** | Core convictions that guide decisions |
| **MODELS.md** | Mental models you use to understand the world |
| **STRATEGIES.md** | Approaches for achieving your goals |
| **NARRATIVES.md** | Stories that define your identity |
| **LEARNED.md** | Key lessons from experience |
| **CHALLENGES.md** | Current obstacles and how you're addressing them |
| **IDEAS.md** | Future possibilities to explore |

## Why Telos Matters

### The Problem
Most people have never articulated:
- Who they are
- What they're working toward
- Why they make the choices they make

This makes them vulnerable to:
- Reactive decision-making
- Loss of direction
- AI displacement (no clear human value-add)

### The Solution
Telos forces explicit articulation of:
- Your unique perspective and contributions
- Your long-term vision
- Your operating principles

This creates:
- Clear decision criteria
- Resilient identity
- AI-augmented growth (AI knows your goals)

## Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Capture** | Add new insight to Telos files | "add to goals", "update challenges" |
| **Review** | Examine current Telos state | "review my telos", "what are my goals" |
| **Reflect** | Guided reflection session | "telos reflection", "life review" |

## Examples

**Review goals:**
```
What are my current goals?
```

**Add a challenge:**
```
Add to challenges: Struggling to maintain focus during deep work sessions
```

**Update mission:**
```
I want to update my mission statement to reflect my new direction
```

**Guided reflection:**
```
Telos reflection - help me think through my goals for this year
```

## Integration

### How PAI Uses Telos

When Telos is populated, your DA can:
- Align suggestions with your goals
- Flag when tasks conflict with stated values
- Remind you of your stated priorities
- Track progress toward goals over time

### Works With
- **Research** — Research aligned with your goals
- **Council** — Debate decisions against your values
- **Algorithm** — ISC criteria informed by Telos

## Getting Started

### Initial Capture

Start with the essentials:

1. **MISSION.md** — One paragraph on your core purpose
2. **GOALS.md** — 3-5 concrete goals for this year
3. **CHALLENGES.md** — Current obstacles

### Iterative Refinement

Telos grows over time:
- Add learnings after significant experiences
- Update goals as priorities shift
- Refine beliefs as understanding deepens

## Notes

- Telos files live in `USER/TELOS/` for upgrade safety
- Review Telos quarterly to keep it current
- Your DA references Telos during goal-oriented tasks
- The more complete your Telos, the more aligned AI assistance becomes
