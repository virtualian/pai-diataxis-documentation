# Developers

**"I want to BUILD ON PAI"**

You're a Developer if you write code that PAI executes - creating skills, building packs, adding hooks, or writing tools. You need to understand file formats, APIs, and system architecture.

**This section covers:** Technical specifications, TypeScript interfaces, and implementation guides for extending PAI.

## Quick Navigation

### How-to Guides

Task-oriented guides for development tasks:

- [Create a Skill](./how-to/create-a-skill) - Build new skills from scratch
